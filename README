OVERVIEW:

1-This project was to design full implementation for Cache by the use of LinkedList  
2- Test the program depends on the text file provided by the instructor and result folde

INCLUDED FILES:
*Cahce.java Source File
* Test.java (Driver class)
*README- this File


COMPILING AND RUNNING:

The format to run the Test class on the command line is the following:

$ Java Test 1 <Positive Integer cache size> <input textfile name>  
OR
$ Java Test 2 <1st-level Positive integer cache size> <2nd-level Positive Integer cache size> <input textfile name>


Then The program will process the file and display the result when it is done.

PROGRAM DESIGN AND IMPORTANT CONCEPTS:

A Cache is designed through the linked list which can have two structure either one-level or double level cache.
 ONE of the most important concepts about the two level cache is Multive inclusion property. 
This means that whenever we instantiate two level cache, the second level should be bigger than the first one,
 and should always contains all the elements in 1st-level cache.


The Cache some kind represents how the computer works. It will read data from the user or a file then search the cache and from this point we have two scenarios:
1- the element is found: we increase the number of hits in the cache and then move element to the front of the Cache as it will have a high probability to be used soon.
This will be done in both 1st and 2nd level cache
2- if it was a miss, and we did not found the element: the program will remove the last element in the cache and add the new element to the front of the cache



TESTING:

This program was tested according to the provided Data from the instructor. I run the program against the file provided and it produced the same output.

DISCUSSION:
 
The main issue was to understand the logic of the Cache and how that will work. This problem was solved through the discussion that was done in class, 
which made the writing the program not very bad. In addition I run into some syntax and small error while writing the program.
